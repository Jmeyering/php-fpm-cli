# php-fpm-cli
Run php code with php-fpm from the command line

This script was taken from a [gist][0] by [Mathias Leppich][1]. [Jmeyering][3] converted it
to a full repository. I just updated it to support php7 and make dependency checks, thus making the script fully compatible with Ubuntu 16.04 on php7.0.
